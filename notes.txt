features:
- add get metrics dict; will enable grabbing all metric events without copying code

design decision:
- should timestamp range be inclusive of end? currently inclusive

idea:
- use earliest/latest in range to group timestamps prior to running serially, using some sort of binary search

todos:
- basic documentation for github
- test-suite
- dedicated demo stores
- read the docs
- requirements.txt
- make clean/simple examples for profiles/events
